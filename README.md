# Moving-Average-Crossover-Strategy
This project implements a basic Moving Average Crossover trading strategy using historical stock data. The strategy involves using two moving averages: a short-term moving average (SMA) and a long-term moving average. The strategy generates buy and sell signals based on the crossover of these moving averages.
